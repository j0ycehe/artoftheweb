                    <h3>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</h3>
                    <p>Seriously underrated. What they lack in menu diversity they 
                        make up in solid food quality. They’re also the only dining 
                        hall that makes breakfast smoothies, though these days I haven’t 
                        been able to get up early enough to snag one. </p>

                    <h3>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</h3>
                    <p>I'd give Houston a 9/10 but their portion sizes are a bit small (and getting smaller).
                        Consistency also can be spotty sometimes but it's a covenient grab-and-go option
                        and the food's great overall. </p>

                    <h3>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</h3>
                    <p>The most gourmet dining food on campus. Honestly we should be paying $17 a swipe
                        for this and not leather-tough Mongolian beef. Presentation, quality, and taste are all chef's kiss. Sometimes the food tastes nowhere near the cuisine
                listed on the menu but it still tastes amazingly wrong.</p>

                    <h3>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</h3>
                    <p>Hit or miss. Sometimes there's nothing appealing, other times I have to get seconds.
                        But if there's one thing the dining halls always get right, it's chicken. Also, 
                        Commons has good fruit (i.e. blackberries and plums).

                    <p>I'd eat here everyday if I could but then my dining dollars would drain within a week. 
                        I'm not much of a coffee drinker so I can't give a take on that but their food tastes fantastic.

                    <h3>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</h3>
                    <p>A Quaker Kitchen and KCECH hybrid. The entree quality falls just short of Quaker Kitchen
                        but unlike Quaker Kitchen where sometimes I'm still hungry after, there's an all-you-can-eat 
                        section that serves decent food. Pain point: the linessssss.

                    <h3>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</h3>
                    <p>I used to eat here nearly every day back when I lived at Hill. Huge selection, but the quality 
                        can be inconsistent. Simply Oasis or Daily Catch is my go-to. I never get the cantaloupe
                        because every time I've had it it tasted sour.
